You will stop feeling pain when you will learn from it
Bros before hoes
Be grateful for what you already have while you pursue your goals. If you aren’t grateful for what you already have, what makes you think you would be happy with more?
Be brave to stand for what you believe in even if you stand alone.
Never lose hope. Storms make people stronger and never last forever.
Do not fear failure but rather fear not trying.
Do you want to know who you are? Don't ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.
Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.
You never change your life until you step out of your comfort zone; change begins at the end of your comfort zone.
Do not let the memories of your past limit the potential of your future. There are no limits to what you can achieve on your journey through life, except in your mind.
The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing.
The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can't achieve it.
Do what you love, love what you do, and with all your heart give yourself to it.
If you believe very strongly in something, stand up and fight for it.
Once you realize you deserve a bright future, letting go of your dark past is the best choice you will ever make.
It's never too late to change your life for the better. You don't have to take huge steps to change your life. Making even the smallest changes to your daily routine can make a big difference to your life.
Always remember people who have helped you along the way, and don’t forget to lift someone up.
Maturity is when you stop complaining and making excuses, and start making changes.
Strong people have a strong sense of self-worth and self-awareness; they don’t need the approval of others.
You cannot change anyone, but you can be the reason someone changes.
